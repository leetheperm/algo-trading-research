Share/cryptocurrecny prices may go down as well as up and you may not get back the original amount invested. You should not buy shares with money you cannot afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets and you should do your own research before investing in or making a trading bot that would invest in cryptocurrencies. I am not liable for any financial decisions made resulting in my research and implore other researchers and potential traders to do their own due dillignece before investing. All research is to be used as a guide only and I recommend you spend more time researching to fully understand the risks involved when trading.
